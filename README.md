Here in this project I have made a ECG design in which the two input terminals can be attached to your body arms and the ECG graph will show up via simulating the same circuit on Hardware.
Instrumentation Amplifier with high common mode rejection ratio is used.
High pass filter (1 Hz),Low pass filter(100 Hz), Notch/Band reject filter(50 Hz) is used.
